============

* AWS Data Wrangler practically only makes integrations. So we prefer to dedicate our energy / time writing integration tests instead of unit tests. We really like an end-to-end approach for all features.

* All integration tests are between a local Docker container and a remote/real AWS service.

* We have a Docker recipe to set up the local end (testing/Dockerfile).

* We have a Cloudformation to set up the AWS end (testing/template.yaml).

Step-by-step
