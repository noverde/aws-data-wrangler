Installation
============

    >>> pip install awswrangler

Runs only with Python 3.6 and beyond.

Runs anywhere (AWS Lambda, AWS Glue Python Shell, EMR, EC2, on-premises, local, etc).

**P.S.** Lambda Layer's bundle and Glue's wheel/egg are available to `download <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler/releases>`_. It's just upload and run! ðŸš€

*P.P.S.* AWS Data Wrangler counts with compiled dependencies (C/C++) so there is no support for Glue PySpark by now.
